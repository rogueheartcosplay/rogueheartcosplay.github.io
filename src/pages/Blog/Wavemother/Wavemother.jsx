            <h3>About the Costume</h3>
              <p>For most, the Wavemother's Robe is an iconic armor set from Baldur's Gate 3. For me, it's a costume that brought me out of my comfort zone and taught me unexpected new skills.</p>
              <p>One of which was the confidence to iterate on my work and make improvements after it was "done". Building up the courage to rip out my previous work was difficult, but I'm glad I did it — even if it turned a "simple" project into a year-long adventure.</p>

            <h3>Patterning</h3>
              <p>
                I started out by draping & flat pattern drafting the dress and sleeves. I went through 3+ mock-ups for the dress itself (and even ended up changing it slightly after the first wear!) 
              </p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>
                There was a lot to consider: how much leg am I comfortable showing? How much plunge? Do I need a corset/special structure? Where do I put the zipper?
              </p>

                The sleeves were by far the most difficult part. They took 5+ mock-ups before I was happy with the look & range of movement. I tried some really funky adjustments to the sleeve cap before landing on a slight puff sleeve (top center photo) to fit my biceps and allow me to raise my arms.

            <h3>Dress Materials</h3>
              <p>
                Amidst the patterning, I ordered a lot of fabric swatches for the fish scale dress. My main three priorities were: 
                <ol>
                  <li>Be a woven pattern -- no prints or faux leather that could deteriorate</li>
                  <li>Have 1" wide scales -- I wanted to match the proportions of the reference</li>
                  <li>Be a suitable shade of aqua -- this is the <strong>wave</strong>mother's robe, after all!</li>
                </ol>
              </p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>
                I ended up finding a lovely upholstery fabric. It's slightly thicker than I wanted and the shade of aqua is a little too green, but it met my first two priorities so I was willing to compromise.

            <h3>Crochet Trim</h3>
              <p>
                While on the hunt for materials, I decided to learn how to crochet so I could make my own lace trim for the robe. It was cost-effective (lace is expensive!), easy to customize, and wouldn’t require any dyeing to get the right shade.
              </p>
              <p>
                After some experimentation, I ended up modifying this <a href="https://freevintagecrochet.com/edging-patterns/spool56/8081-chippendale-edging-pattern">free vintage pattern. </a>
                The trim was made with size 30 thread and a size 10 hook. There are about 12 yards total in the cosplay!

            <h3>Dress</h3>
              <p>There are very few seams in the reference, so I tried to minimize them in my pattern. The front and back (excluding skin tone panels) are only 6 pieces total.</p>

              <p>The back skin tone panel is stretchy, and the front is non-stretch woven. I made them opaque for my own comfort and to hide any undergarments.</p>

              <p>I also began to sew an underbust corset bunnysuit (modified Aranea Black pattern). After doing a test fit, I decided not to wear one with the costume. C'est la vie!</p>

              <p>All of the chains were assembled with coral-shaped connectors, glass bead connectors, and tiny brass rings. </p>
              <p>A few of the chains broke during a test fit, so I added lobster clasps to the leg chains to make putting the costume on/off easier. This is why I frequently test fit costumes while creating them.</p>

            <h3>Necklace</h3>
              <p>The necklace was a super quick foam build! First, I drew a rough pattern and adjusted it on paper.</p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>I used 2mm EVA foam for the base, 5mm half dowels for the rounded lines, and puff paint for the tiny filigree.</p>
              <p>To assemble, I glued each layer of foam with contact cement. While gluing, I made sure to wear a respirator and gloves in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling or touching the contact cement.</p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>After assembling, I used a rotary tool with a small stone bit (see left photo) to smooth out the edges of the gems and add small squiggles to them. While using the rotary tool, I wore safety glasses and a dust mask to protect myself.</p>

              <p>The paint is PlaidFX flexible acrylic paint. I used a few layers of their primer, a few layers of gold, and added some iridescent highlights. The gems are painted with multiple layers of aqua and iridescent paint.</p>

              <p>The back of the necklace closes with a sew-on snap. I sewed a piece of ribbon to one side of the necklace, then sewed the snap closure to the other side.</p>
              <p>The center ring was a thrifty find — I used an old key ring. This made it easy to change out the center front jewelry if needed.</p>

            <h3>Armor</h3>
              <p>The shoulder armor was a very similar process to the necklace. It used all of the same materials.</p>
              <p>I placed clear tape on my dress form, drew the pattern with permanent marker, and transferred it to paper. From there, I freehanded the swirl pattern and cut the armor out of foam.</p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>Once again, I glued the foam together with contact cement. Don't forget the respirator and gloves in a well-ventilated area!</p>
              <p>The raised border is 5mm half-dowel foam, the swirl details are 2mm foam, and the base shape is 5mm foam.</p>
              <p>This time, I used a rotary tool to smooth out the edges and add small divots to the armor. I wore safety glasses and a dust mask for this step as well.</p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>Finally, I used more PlaidFX flexible paint. I primed with black paint, painted the swirls with multiple shades of aqua, and highlighted everything with iridescent paint. All of the swirls were accentuated with a thin line of silver paint on one edge.</p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>To attach the shoulder armor to the dress, I used two-part purse magnets. I stitched one side to the dress and glued the other side to the armor with E6000. Since this glue is toxic, I wore a respirator and gloves in a well-ventilated area while working with it.</p>
              <p>I also made sure to score the surface of the foam with a knife so the glue had more purchase.</p>

              <p>The magnets make it very easy to put the armor on. They also lower the risk of breaking anything. For example, if the armor gets caught on my wig it'll just pop off!</p>

            <h3>Owlbear Plush</h3>
              <p>I now interrupt our regularly scheduled costuming to introduce an adorable owlbear plush!</p>
              <p>To create her, I used a crochet pattern by ComplicatedKnots and added my own details. (A worthy second crochet project ever, right?)</p>

              <p>I patterned all of the white "fur" sections with paper and made them out of fuzzy fabric. The eyes and beak were sculpted from worbla and painted to look like wood. These were all hand stitched to the crochet base. </p>

            <h3>First Wear</h3>
              <p>At this point, I was ready to debut version 1.0 at C2E2. I was really happy with the costume overall, but ended up making some upgrades.</p>

            <h3>Improvements</h3>
              <p>My first grievance was the center front skin tone panel. The fabric would wrinkle and I didn’t love the way it looked. Even though I was nervous about removing it, I knew I wouldn’t want to wear the costume again if I left it as-is.</p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>The first step to fixing it was removing most of the panel. As you can see from these progress photos, I was not happy with the initial change and was very worried that I made the wrong decision. Thankfully it got better from there!</p>

              <p>This also meant that I needed to remove the built-in bra that I created for the costume. I was sad to see it go, but it's undamaged and can be used for another costume :')</p>
              <p>Next, I made a really strong clear strap out of nylon corset mesh to hold the center front together. This caused the neckline below the strap to wrinkle, so I added spiral steel boning to each side of the V.</p>

        <div className="content">
              <p>The narrow point of the V neckline is still the skin tone panel! I left it in to cover the waistband of my tights. Thankfully you can barely tell it's there because the horizontal coral connector hides the transition.</p>
              <p>Can you tell I was much happier with the changes at this point? XD</p>

              <p>The other upgrade I made to the center front was to sculpt a new jewelry connector. In part to be more accurate, and in part to cover the clear strap that I just added. </p>

            <h3>Cape</h3>
              <p>After the much-needed improvements I switched gears and made a cape!</p>
              <p>I patterned it by folding a huge piece of paper, making sure to include the pleats. </p>

              <p>The wave motif was hand drawn and painted with acrylics and silver gel pen. Before painting, I thread marked the outline so I didn't need to use pencil or chalk. It was really soothing to sit outside and paint.</p>
