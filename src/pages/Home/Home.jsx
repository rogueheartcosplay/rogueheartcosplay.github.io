        <h2>Crafter, Cosplayer, Gamer</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm Heather, a Chicago-based cosplay maker with a passion for video games. By day I'm a software developer, and by night I spent my time sewing, 3D modeling, and foamsmithing. I love to focus on craftsmanship and enjoy researching new techniques. I've made costumes from games such as Baldur's Gate 3, Horizon Forbidden West, and  Nier: Automata. For my most recent work, find me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rogueheartcosplay/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> â€” and thanks for visiting!</p>
